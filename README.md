# bash-scripting
Contain various bash script that could be used by anyone. They are made in my free time.

List of all files contained in this repo:

* create_file.sh: This script create any file (odt, docx, pptx..) from a large collection depending on the user's needs. It uses a free and open-source document converter called [Pandoc](https://pandoc.org/).
* empty_folder.sh: This script will ask the name of the folder you want to empty, then erase all the data it may contain and check if it has successfully been emptied.

## Prerequisites

In order to execute any script, you should give it permission:

```
chmod +x /path/to/yourscript.sh
```

To run your script:

```
/path/to/yourscript.sh
```   
    
Since `.` refers to the current directory: if `yourscript.sh` is in the current directory, you can simplify this to:

```
./yourscript.sh
```
