# bash-scripting
Contain various bash script that could be used by anyone. They are made in my free time.

## Prerequisites

In order to execute the script, you should give it permission:

```
chmod +x /path/to/yourscript.sh
```

To run your script:

```
/path/to/yourscript.sh
 
```   
    
Since `.` refers to the current directory: if `yourscript.sh` is in the current directory, you can simplify this to:

```
./yourscript.sh
```
